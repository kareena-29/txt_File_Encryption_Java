# txt_File_Encryption_Java
This is simple code using networking wherein encryption is a applied onto a txt file and then decrypted. The encrypted and decrypted file are saved in the current folder only!

This works well for txt files

Your encrypted file will be saved in the same folder by the name, -> EncryptedFile.txt and decrypted one as -> check.txt

First run -> FileSenderEncrypt.java and then FileReceiverEncrypt.java
